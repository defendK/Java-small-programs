# Java Small Programs

This repository contains a collection of small Java programs I’ve coded throughout my studies, from basic syntax exercises to programs of intermediate complexity. These projects were developed to reinforce key programming concepts and improve my understanding of Java.

## 💡 What's Inside

- 📚 Basic syntax and structure
- 🔁 Loops and conditionals
- 🧮 Arrays and data structures
- 🔤 Strings and text processing
- 🔢 Math operations
- 🧰 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) (if applicable)

Each program is self-contained and focused on a specific concept or task. These are great for anyone learning Java or looking for example solutions to practice problems.
